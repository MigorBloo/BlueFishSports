Workflow:

### üîê Authentication System
- User registration and login
- Email verification
- Password reset functionality

1)	Login Page (Starting Page):

The user logs in with his email address and password (which he created during the registration process).

Below that there is a link to the registration page as well as to reset the password.

The two outcomes are

i)	User logs in successfully and gets to the Main Landing Page
ii)	Error logging in due to incorrect credentials

2)	Registration Page:

The registration page has the following fields

-	First Name

-	Last Name

-	Username

-	Email Address

-	Password

-	Country of Residence (Dropdown Menu)

           Below there is a link to get to the login page

The two outcomes are:

i)	An authentication email will be sent to your email address for you to verify
ii)	Error registering user (due to invalid entries and/or the user already being registered)

The user should receive an authentication email and once he confirms it by clicking on a confirmation button he will be directed to the login page where he can login with his Email and password.

3)	Resetting Password/Forgot Password

By clicking on Forgot Password you enter your email address to which your password reset link will be sent. Once the email is received and the link is clicked on, the user will be prompted to enter a new password and confirm it before he will be redirected again to the Login page.

###  üìã App Features:

1) Landing Page (Main Page):

Once the user logs in successfully, he will be directed to the Landing Page/Main Page where the links to all the individual games will be (the game containers).

Navigation Bar: Located at the top of the page with the Game Logo on the top left, the Username with Welcome message in the middle and then the Logout Button on the right. The user can click on the Username to get to the User Profile page where he can see his Email Address and Username and change his Username.

The Game Containers: All the Game containers are displayed here including an short introductory headline story about the game and then below the characteristics of the game (Sport, Type, Start Date, End Date, Duration and Time till Lock as well as the Status). At the bottom of each container the user can click on the Play Now button to access the individual game.

### The Games:

2)  üèÄ NBA Mock Draft

- Pick positions are predetermined but users can change team positions (by clicking the trade toggle), if they think a team will trade their pick, and select the player they think will be drafted by that team.
-Each round will be scored based on how accurate the predictions are(comparing them to the actual Draft result). The user that has the highest point total accumulated over 30 rounds wins

Key to Success: The key to winning is not for you to make the most rational decision for a team but rather anticipate what a team will do.
